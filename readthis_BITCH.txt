Set Up Project Structure

Install and configure necessary tools (Poetry, Cookiecutter).
Use Cookiecutter to create a basic project structure.
Initialize a version control system (e.g., Git).
Prepare Data Acquisition and Processing Framework

Research and list potential targets from literature.
Develop a Python class to handle data acquisition for various targets.
Implement methods for querying databases (e.g., ChEMBL, PubChem).
Include functionality for data cleaning and preprocessing.
Test the class with a few targets to ensure functionality.
Notebook Development and Integration

Adapt modified talktorials into Jupyter Notebooks.
Ensure each notebook contains:
Clear methods and comments for different target processing.
Visualization techniques relevant to each target.
Code annotations linking to relevant papers.
Defined metrics for reinforcement learning algorithm input.
Test notebooks for a range of targets to validate their applicability.
Generative Model Development

Research and download multiple generative model codes.
Create a separate directory in the repository for model codes.
Test each model with a few selected targets to ensure compatibility.
Modify and combine ideas from various papers to develop your proprietary model.
Test the proprietary model with initial targets.
Integrating Reinforcement Learning Algorithm

Design and implement a reinforcement learning algorithm.
Integrate the algorithm with the generative model.
Define and code the reward system based on the metrics identified in the notebooks.
Test the integrated system with initial targets for validation.
Automatic Target Identification Integration

(Future Task) Research and plan the integration of algorithms for automatic target identification.
Develop a module for disease-specific target identification.
Integrate this module with the existing generative model framework.
Documentation and Version Control

Continuously document the development process and code.
Regularly update the repository with changes and new features.
Ensure clear version control for tracking and collaboration purposes.
Testing and Validation

Perform thorough testing of each component (data acquisition, models, algorithms).
Validate the entire system with multiple targets and diseases.
Refinement and Optimization

Refine the algorithms and models based on testing feedback.
Optimize code for efficiency and scalability.
Final Integration and Deployment

Integrate all components into a cohesive system.
Prepare the system for deployment (if applicable).
Conduct final testing to ensure readiness.
