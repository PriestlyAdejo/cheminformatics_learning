Need to run the opencadd pipeline here and modify its output files to go into the correct
directories for /data/
so assuming we just find the data from pdb or chembl we need to modify its save path to go to external
after doing some processing we do things like moving to other stages and so on rather than having file save paths
be thinbgs like 1_protein 2_ligand and so on.


need to then parameterise evertythoing so its all in one space to be run easily. So this is like setting thinigs like
enums or other things such as parameters to use in classes.

the data directoryt itself also needs another subdirectory for model training data from MOses etc as well as all the other
required things to make it work.

reprots are where figures form the above analyses go as well as different explanabuiity metrics form the given models.
