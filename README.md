# Drug Discovery for Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma

## Project Overview
Welcome to the GitHub repository for my bachelor's thesis project on drug discovery for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). This project encompasses several key stages, each focusing on a specific aspect of the drug discovery process. As the sole contributor to this repository, I am using this platform to document my progress, findings, and code related to this research.

### Project Stages
This project is divided into several stages, with a flexible approach to completion:

### Stage 1: Target Identification for Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma Using Machine Learning

**Intermediate Steps:**
1. **Data Collection**: Gather genomics and proteomics data related to intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean, preprocess, and integrate the collected data into a usable format.
3. **Feature Selection**: Identify relevant features and biomarkers that can be indicative of potential drug targets.
4. **Machine Learning Model Development**: Develop machine learning models to analyze the data and identify potential therapeutic drug targets.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the machine learning models and select the most promising targets.

### Stage 2: Predicting Drug Candidates for Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma: A Virtual Screening Approach

**Intermediate Steps:**
1. **Chemical Library Selection**: Choose chemical libraries for virtual screening.
2. **Virtual Screening Pipeline**: Develop a computational pipeline for virtual screening, including ligand and receptor preparation.
3. **Docking Simulations**: Perform docking simulations to predict binding affinities between drug candidates and identified targets.
4. **Scoring and Ranking**: Implement scoring functions to rank potential drug candidates based on binding affinity.
5. **Validation**: Validate the virtual screening results against known drug candidates and experimentally validated compounds.

### Stage 3: Molecular Docking and Dynamics Simulations for Lead Optimization in ICC Drug Discovery

**Intermediate Steps:**
1. **Lead Identification**: Select top-ranking drug candidates from virtual screening results.
2. **Molecular Docking**: Perform molecular docking simulations to understand the binding modes of selected compounds.
3. **Molecular Dynamics Simulations**: Conduct molecular dynamics simulations to assess the stability and interactions over time.
4. **Binding Energy Analysis**: Calculate binding energies to prioritize lead compounds.
5. **Lead Optimization**: Modify lead compounds to improve binding affinity and drug-likeness properties.

### Stage 4: Machine Learning in Drug Verification for Liver Cancers: Case Studies in ICC

**Intermediate Steps:**
1. **Dataset Preparation**: Collect experimental data on drug candidates and their interactions with ICC targets.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Create informative features for machine learning, including structural and pharmacological properties.
3. **Model Training**: Train machine learning models to predict drug efficacy and validate against experimental data.
4. **Validation and Interpretation**: Evaluate model performance and interpret feature importance.
5. **Case Studies**: Apply machine learning models to verify the efficacy of selected drug candidates.

### Stage 5: Integrated Approaches in Drug Discovery for Bile Duct Cancers

**Intermediate Steps:**
1. **Literature Review**: Conduct an extensive literature review on drug discovery in bile duct cancers.
2. **Data Integration**: Integrate findings from stages 1 to 4 into a comprehensive drug discovery strategy.
3. **Comparative Analysis**: Compare the effectiveness of machine learning-driven target identification, virtual screening, and lead optimization with traditional methods.
4. **Synthesis of Results**: Synthesize the results and insights obtained throughout the project.
5. **Thesis Writing**: Begin writing the final thesis, incorporating all findings and conclusions.

Please note that due to time constraints, I may prioritize stages 1 to 3 within the given timeframe of my bachelor's thesis. Stages 4 and 5 will be completed in my spare time if necessary, to ensure a comprehensive exploration of drug discovery in bile duct cancers.
